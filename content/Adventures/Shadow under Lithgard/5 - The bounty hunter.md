Description:

A tall and slender human male approaches you. He wears a wide brimmed, tall hat and is clad in dark robes. A mischivious smile plays around his lips. Before you can say anything he exclaims: "Today might be your lucky day! I'm looking for information and I'm willing to pay a good price for it! But let me introduce myself first... the name is Sir Loyd Rouse. And who do I have the pleasure of speaking too?".

Will attack the players if they have something that he deems that it belongs to him.

## Sir Loyd Rouse

**Bond**: His family and their estate back in Luskan.

**Ideal**: I get the job done quickly, no matter what it takes. I'm efficient and ruthless.

**Flaw**: Rouse is a masochist and quickly lets it get the better of him.
