# Mushroom Cave 

* to the south of Lithgard
* home of the little mushroom guy
* none of the myconids are responsive
* small mushroom guy signals to his friends that the source of the mushrooms problems is somewhere deeper in the cave
* players start hallucinating the farther they get into the cave -> myconid spores afect them
* The shared dream of the myconids is affected by a spectator that is feeding off their psychic powers

Work with the following descriptions:

#### Cave Entrance:

"As you approach the **southern side of the island** the air is humid and **thick with fog**. The entrance to the myconid cave lies between at the **foot of a cliff** face in the shade of a dense forest. You can see a **steep slope** leading into the cave proper and at the end of the tunnel it seems you can make out a glint of greenish light"

#### The Main Cave:

"You make your way down the slope and at its bottom the cave opens up to a low, but wide cavern. Everything in sight is covered by all manners of funghi. Many of them give of light in colors ranging from blue, over green to even a hint of purple. The air is filled with spores that swirl around you as you step through the cavern. Everywhere around you you can make out myconids sitting and standing as if being part of the fauna."

#### The Bridge:

"You can see another much larger cavern open up in front of you. The cave you just entered is an underground ravine and only a small bridge leads across to the next tunnel on the other side. There are some unresponsive myconids sitting near the ravine. The air is still thick with their spores. Beneath the bridge runs a quick stream of water. As you look towards its origin you can see only blackness, but there seems to be another cave opening farther upstream where you can spot another glint of light."

Random psychedelic encounters are hallucinations with which the spectator wants to scare away the PCs.
These are normal creatures with only a single hitpoint. Use creatures of your choice here. Anything from hillgiants to wolves to deamons.

#### The main cave:

"As you make your way into the main cave you step into the largest cavern you have been in today. It is like a small church and at the end you can make out the large body of the myconid sovereign. A large mushroom that encompasses the entire side of the wall. Its many eyes are closed as if it was sleeping. The rest of the room is completely overgrown with mushrooms. There is not a single spot that isn't some sort of plant or myconid."


#### When touching the mirror:

"You gently touch the mirrors surface and your touch sends ripples across it. It is as if the mirror grows in front of you and it is quickly encompassing your entire field of vision. As you look around the cave seems to fold in on itself and is swallowed up by the starry night sky you saw earlier behind you reflection. The gentle transition ends as quickly as it began. You now stand in what seems like very shallow water. Above you stars are twinkling and nebulas are twisting in beautiful colors. Beneath you the reflective surface of the water seems to stretch on endlessly."

#### When investigating the astral sea:

"Off in the distance you see an anomaly in the smooth, reflective plain. As you approach you can make out something hideous. It looks like a dismembered skull of sorts. Its skin is shrivelled and whiteish and it only has a single currently shut eye. The unnaturally large skull seems to sprout tentacles in all directions, which seem to penetrate the perfectly smooth surface beneath you. After a second or so the skull starts to lift from the ground, its tentacles separating from the plane beneath. And then its eyes start opening one by one. Firstly the eyes placed on the end of its tentacles and at last the eye in the middle. They glint at you with greenish, crazed look."
