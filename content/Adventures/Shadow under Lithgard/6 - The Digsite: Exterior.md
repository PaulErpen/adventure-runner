# The Digsite: Exterior

The digsite lies atop the tallest hill on Lithgard.
From a far one can see a giant swarm of ravens circling above the digsite.


There are **patrols of undead** roaming outside the walls of the digsite, that will blow an alert horn should they notice the players.
Every time the players draw attention to themselves **1d6 ravens will veer of the swarm and start attacking the players**.
Both the ravens and the undead won't try to kill the players, but they will try to deter them.

If the situation gets critical Mother Elise and Anais will show up and  resolve the conflict.

## Mother Elise

**Bond**: The harpys of Lithgard.

**Ideal**: I aspire to greatness and eternal life. Even if it means that i will have to do the unspeakable.

**Flaw**: Has a lot more empathy than she would like, which can oftentimes interfere with her ambition. She is a very conflicted person.
